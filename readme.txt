Custom Css classes are:

1. first (.first)
The first class is used to style the first letter in each paragraph. It will
set the display as well as color, font-size, line-height, among other properties.
This class is used many times throughout the website design.

2. name (.name)
This class is used to set the properties for the name of the website in the
header. This class is used across the three pages of the website to provide
consistency in the header. Class will style the font, size, background color
etc.

3. primary, secondary, teriatry (.primary col, secondary col, tertiary col)
These are three classes that are related to each other. They make up the 
the three columns of the first page. The col part will allow for styling
across the three columns in unison while the the idvidual columns are able
to be styled using the first name. This allows for specific padding and margin
settings to make the text more readable for the user.



Javascript functions are:

1. Double event listener(mouseover, mouseout)
These two functions respond to user interaction with the site. Whenever
the user runs the mouse of over the buttons on the page the background
color of the button will change and change back when the cursor is removed


2. Click Event (click)
When the user clicks on the button to submit their email or submit the 
form the site will confirm and thank you the user for their interaction.
